# Transparency Patcher

Transparency Patcher allows you to patch your Discord installation so that truly transparant themes can be used. As in, you know, being able to see through the Discord window. It's pretty cool.

### Instructions
Instructions on how to install it can be found [here](https://github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/BetterDiscord-Themes-and-Plugins/wiki/Transparency-Patcher-FAQ). And please, read them carefully. If it does not work, try again or give up. Due to too many people asking me, I will not give any support.
